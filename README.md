# Cnn inappropriate Image Classifier | Pytorch


## Project description
<p align="justify">This is multiclass classifier written in Python3. I've created a Convolutional Neural Network to classify images to one of three target class:
<p>
<ol>
<li> porn/nudity images
<li> violence images
<li> standard images
</ol>
<p align="justify"> Basic accuracy was about 60%. I've reached evaulation accuracy level around 93%. Model was overfitted and biased for only porn image class. 
I've used several techniques to avoid overfitting, minimaze loss and improve accuracy of each image class: <p>

* expanding dataset size
* data augmentation - additional transforms
* learning rate scheduling
* testing various model's architectures
* dropouts

## Flask App
<p align="justify">
I've wrote simple app which can use model's file with .pth extension. Predicting method requests for image file with three most common image extensions: .png, .jpeg and .jpg.
File validation is included, predicting function returns predicted class and class name.

## Motivation
This project was created certainly in education purposes. All the research about datasets and deep learning methods didn't bring me any benefitts.

## Libraries

* Pytorch
* Torchvision
* OS
* Flask
* PIL
* IO
